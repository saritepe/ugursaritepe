# App Deployment

I always thought it is hard to serve or publish something.
At least it was hard when I try to deploy backend apps.
Need to rent a server or cloud and setup all the dependencies, 
then setup the networking create a public ip etc. But for next.js apps
I would say it is pretty easy. You just need vercel account and you can
setup pretty fast with command line tool. Which asks you just a couple
questions then actually setup everything for you automatically and serve
it via public ip address so you can also share with anyone. Bonus it is
free for the people like me (who does not have a lot of users)


## Step 1: First Deployment
So first step is creating account which I don't remember when I did how I did.
But my account is hobby account and I have 4-5 hobby projects. As long as you 
don't have a lot of traffic you can just use hobby. 

Normally I use npx to use vercel commands instead of installing but if you want
to use directly you can also install with 

```
npm install -g vercel
```

Then you can use vercel commands from your cli directly but I use npx instead.

To initialize my project with vercel I use :

```
npx vercel init
```

Then it asks bunch of question and you need to login with your account but it 
creates .vercel file in your directory with some id to be able access it later on.

For delpoyment it is enough to just write:

```
npx vercel
```

For deployment vercel has nice feature it is deploying a test server and you can 
actually check how is it and you can deploy prod with:

```
npx vercel --prod
```

Basically that is it. You will have an app with this command in production and
it will print production dns with something-something.vercel.app
You can check you website and share with anyone. 

If you want to check [more] (https://vercel.com/docs)

I know that this is actually pretty simple and maybe not something learn like a 
tutorial but I think it is important to know that is easy. If you have a idea 
or app you can just publish it!

## What's Next

I would like to also add how I add domain for ugursaritepe and how did I share with
search engine like google.
