![Google Search Console showing first 5 clicks](/images/blog/first-clicks-from-google/google-search-console.png)

I got surprised by email from google search console that shows I had some actual users or at least some page views,
clicks coming from google search. My [game-scout.app](https://game-scout.app) got 5 clicks from search console.


## What is game-scout?

game-scout is a game search engine. Right now just for ps5, I fetched all the games and
try to add filters that I like. Like co-op games or sorting games with rating and rate count together.
If you want to know more about the project, check out [game-scout project page](/projects/game-scout).

## The Accidental SEO Strategy

So after a couple weeks I realized no one is actually using the website. I was trying to 
get some users with reddit posts and try to make some comments but it was also hard 
without making like an advertisement. 

So I decided to make use of seo and google search engine but I had just one page for filtering
games. It was not ideal for SEO. Then I decided to create a few pages, classic seo pages like
best rpg games, action games etc. 

In here I just put an extra best medical games. This was actually just for me to check, 
because when I was creating website, I asked feedback from my wife and she told me that
she is looking for medical games but it does not show anything. So while developing I always
use medical games as test. I wanted to make sure it always show something.

So I was not waiting a lot from these pages because I know there are tons of blogs article,
but I am surprised to see I got first 5 clicks. Then What I see from console is, that 5 click is for 
medical games actually. 

## What the 5 Clicks Actually Mean

So for me even 5 click is important. I know it is just 5 but it was 0 before and I know that
I have something to work on now. I can try to improve more and maybe get more users. 


## What I Learned

Go for the niches

## What's Next

Now I know that I can get some users from google, I actually need to improve my website and results.
I am not sure they relavent enough, also UI is bothering me in mobile. I will try to focus improving
mobile and get better results. 

Also I would like to get some feedback from users, I will try to add a popup but I dont want to bother
or push away users, so still thinking about how can I do it nicely.
