# Hello World

```python
print("Hello World!")
```

This is my start. I want to talk about why I decided to do create blog so later 
on I can always come back to here. 

## Who am I

I am Uğur, I have been developer for last 8 years. I always loved developing apps 
and working on some home projects. You can find more about me [here](/about). 

## Why I'm Starting This Blog

Eventhough I love creating projects, I am actually terrible at making structured way 
to handle this projects and document them. Generally it becomes a sphagetti after I
work some time.

My other challange is finding users for my apps. I love creating apps, coding, 
automating and the best feeling is when you solve the issues and it starts working.
But then unfortunately no one is using it, including me. 

Last one is actually troubleshooting. Eventhough I fix some issues in time like 
versioning, special cases, implementation details, some stackoverflow code, 
os related special codes, I forget about them after 6 months. When I start 
new project, and see same error code and I am like oh I know this one, but
how did I solve it? I have no idea...

So with these problems in my mind, and discussing with some friends, 
one of them is actually chatgpt unfortunately, I decided to create this blog.

My main goal is documenting and actually learning how to do it. I don't even
take notes for myself how can I start documenting for others? 

Also it would be nice to structure my projects, keep them tidy and open sourced
so I would be also more carefull and pay more attention. So at least my future
self can benefit from it.

Lastly I can meet more people who has similar goals or had same issues with me 
and maybe I can help them a bit.

## What to Expect

I'll be writing about:

- **Projects I'm building** — The good, the bad, and the bugs
- **Technical challenges** — How I approach and solve problems
- **Tools and workflows** — What makes me productive
- **Lessons learned** — Mistakes are the best teachers

## What's Next

I will add my projects to this platform and start adding their state. After that I will
start coding with documenting like which features I add or what did I do for that project.
