I recently got my first clicks, visitors from google search engine. I also created a post
about it to explain how to get first clicks. You can check here: [First 5 Clicks from Google Search](/blog/20251217-first-clicks-from-google)

## What Changed

### Niche Category Pages

So because I started got some impressions and clicks:

![Google Search Console impressions and clicks for last month](/images/blog/game-scout-seo-improvements/search-console-stats.png)

I decided to grow from here. First thing that comes to my mind is try to multiply this approach.
I had one niche page that always get click best medical games for ps5, so I thought creating 
similar niches. Now I wanted to go doubling multipling categories. Like stealth survival, coop racing etc. 

So I created new page for all the [categories](https://www.game-scout.app/categories) I created and put a menu so user can
navigate from. 

### Individual Game Slugs

Since I started to work on seo more, I decided to change individual pages for games.
Normally all game urls were like game/id but I wanted to change this to game/elden-ring
initially I wanted to have just a slug but claude code automatically change the backend api 
to fetch data with id to slug. I did not want to change backend for just this changes so 
I asked him to keep id when making request so it changed url in this way to keep both 
id and slug. I am sure there is better way but I thought it is fine as long as 
name is in url I have better change on search engines. 


### Metadata per Game

I saw that I did not have canonical and it was showing error in search console panel of google.
Firstly I started with this so I have unique canonical per game. I added simple metadata 
and OG tags for now. But I did not put too much time right now it shows original 
description from ps store which is not good for search engines. I need to actually 
create good title and description per game. Also would be better to add VideoGame schema.


## What's Next

Now first I will watch closely if I can get more clicks and impressions from new pages. 
I will check if individual pages got some love. 

Later I would like to add VideoGame schema and more crafted title and descriptions 
for metadata. Maybe I can generate some good summary, description per game later on 
and I can use this description also in my app too.
