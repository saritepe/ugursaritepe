## Overview

Game Scout is a tool to search games. Instead of relying just genres, it has 
AI powered tags, themes and mechanics that lets users to find games. Also included
smart ranking system that calculates from rate and rate count together.

## The Problem

Traditional game search platforms only match exact keywords. If you search 
for "medical games," you might only get games with "medical" in the title, 
missing out on surgery simulators, hospital management games, and health 
education titles.

## The Solution

Game Scout uses advanced categorization:

- **Search**: Find tag, theme, mecanics or description
- **Ordering**: Order games with weighted rating algorithm
- **Advanced Filters**: Combine co-op mode, player count, difficulty, and specific mechanics
- **Plus Mode**: Find games that support specific features like local co-op, split-screen

## Key Features

### Advanced Filters
- **Player Modes**: Single-player, co-op, local-multiplayer etc.
- **Game Mechanics**: story-driven, crafting, turn-based, stealth
- **Plus Filters**: Included in PS Plus, Extra or Free games

### Smart Ranking System
- **Weighted Rating Algorithm**: Uses both rating score and rating count to find truly great games
- Prevents high-rated games with only few reviews from dominating results
- Balances popularity with quality to surface hidden gems
- Customizable sorting by best-rated, most popular, or balanced score

### Smart Categorization
- Automatically categorizes games into 50+ mechanics and themes
- Games can belong to multiple categories
- Genre-blending discovery (find games that mix your favorite styles)

### Precise Discovery
Combine multiple filters to find exactly what you want:
- "4-player local co-op puzzle games"
- "Story-driven action games"
- "Medical simulation games"

## Technical Highlights

- **Frontend**: Next.js
- **Backend**: Python
- **Database**: Postgres
- **Scraping**: Playwright
- **Tagging**: OpenAI

## Current State

The app works and I actually use it myself to find games. But honestly, I have zero other users.

The features are there, search works well, but getting users is a completely different challenge
that I haven't figured out yet.
