## Why I Built This

I've been coding for 8 years and always worked on side projects. But I'm terrible at documenting them.

My projects usually turn into spaghetti code after a while because I don't keep track of what I did or why.
I also forget solutions to problems I've already solved - I'll see an error and think "oh I fixed this before"
but have no idea how.

Plus, I want to actually finish projects and maybe get some users. Having a public place to document
everything might help me stay more organized and accountable.

So I built this blog to:
- Document my projects and their progress
- Write about technical challenges and solutions
- Keep update logs so I remember what I did
- Maybe connect with people who have similar interests

## What It Is

Just a simple Next.js website with:
- **Blog posts** in MDX format - easy to write with markdown and add code snippets
- **Projects section** - each project gets its own page with status, tech stack, update logs, and future plans
- **Clean design** - nothing fancy, just readable and functional

## The Tech

- **Next.js 14** with App Router - familiar with it from other projects
- **TypeScript** - for type safety
- **MDX** - so I can write blog posts and project pages in markdown
- **Tailwind CSS** - quick styling without writing much CSS
- **Vercel** - easy deployment, just push to GitHub

Everything is static site generated, so it's fast and SEO friendly.

## Current State

The structure is there and working. I wrote my first blog post explaining why I'm doing this.

Now I need to actually use it - add my projects, write updates, and get into the habit of documenting.
