## Overview

Find Quotes is a quote discovery platform that helps users find the perfect quote through emotion tags, artist filtering, and exact text matching. It includes a custom image generator to create shareable quote graphics.

## The Problem

The initial version used RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) with in-memory embedding models for semantic search. While powerful, it consumed excessive resources since everything ran in-memory without external embedding services. Without real users, the infrastructure costs couldn't be justified.

## The Solution

Rebuilt as a lean Next.js application deployed on Vercel:

- **File-based Storage**: Quotes stored in static files for zero database overhead
- **Multiple Search Methods**: Emotion tags, artist filtering, and exact text matching
- **Image Creation**: Custom quote graphics with 6 template options
- **Serverless Architecture**: Pay-per-use model that scales with actual usage

## Key Features

### Search & Discovery
- **Emotion Tags**: Find quotes by mood (inspirational, melancholic, motivational, etc.)
- **Artist Filter**: Browse quotes from specific authors
- **Text Search**: Exact string matching for finding specific phrases

### Image Generator
- **6 Template Options**: Choose from different visual styles
- **Quote Placement**: Position text on images for optimal readability
- **Download**: Export custom quote images for sharing

## Technical Highlights

- **Frontend**: Next.js for fast, SEO-friendly rendering
- **Deployment**: Vercel for serverless hosting
- **Design**: Lightweight, cost-effective architecture

## Current State

The app is live and functional at find-quotes.com with a curated collection of example quotes. The focus is on getting users first before investing in advanced features.
