# Purpose

I want a personal website that acts as both a **developer blog** and a **project showcase**.  
It should reflect me as a calm, confident, minimalist builder.

**Main goals:**
- Share my development journey, decisions, and problem-solving.
- Showcase my projects and link to their live demos or GitHub.
- Document progress for personal growth and visibility.

**Tone:** calm, confident, conversational, and developer-friendly.
